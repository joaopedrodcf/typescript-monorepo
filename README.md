## Folder structure
```
packages/                       // feel free to add more components in this folder
    app/                        // main app that will use all the components
        src/
            index.ts
            button.tsx
            styles.tsx
        package.json            // everytime you need a new devDependency add it here
        tsconfig.json           // every package from the monorepo that you import you need to add it to references
    storybook/                  // storybook that will run all the components
        stories/                // feel free to add more components in this folder
            header/
            button/
                index.tsx
                index.stories.tsx
        package.json            // everytime you need a new devDependency add it here
        tsconfig.json           // every package from the monorepo that you import you need to add it to references
    header/                     // a header component
    button/                     // a button component
package.json                    // everytime you need a new devDependency add it here
tsconfig.json                   // everytime you add a new package modify this file by adding the new package path
```
## Typescript references

Every time you add a new package you must do the following

1. Add to root tsconfig.json the path of the new package
2. If this package is a dependency of another package you also need to add it to the parent tsconfig.json file

WIP: Create an automatic way of creating the project references

## :keyboard: Commands

Run all the commands from the root folder
The monorepo is built in a way where you don't need to change from the root to run any command

### Install dependencies
```
yarn
```

### Start dev server
```
yarn start
```

### Start production server (SSR)
```
yarn start:server
```

### Typescript build
```
yarn build
```

### Typescript watch
```
yarn watch
```

### Lint all the project
```
yarn lint
```

### Test all the project
```
yarn test
```

### Find duplicated dependencies on the project
```
yarn test:dependencies
```

### Start storybook
```
yarn storybook
```

### Heroku deploy
On your project do this steps:

Login in your heroku account
```
heroku login
```

This will create a project in the heroku account you loggedin previously
```
heroku create
```

Can be master or main the next command depending on your repo
```
git push heroku master
```

Note: This part requires you to have a heroku account
